## Overview

This LMS allows users to:
- List all courses and their associated teachers
- View a userâ€™s profile and the courses they teach
- Retrieve course statistics, including the number of courses, min/max/average prices, and most/least popular courses

## Features

- **Course Management**: Lists available courses and their associated teachers.
- **User Profiles**: Retrieves information about a specific user and the courses they are teaching.
- **Course Statistics**: Provides aggregate data about the courses, including min/max/average price and popularity.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Uses Django Silk for profiling to track SQL queries and optimize performance.

## Technologies

- **Django** - Web framework for Python
- **Django Silk** - For profiling and performance monitoring
- **PostgreSQL** - Database for storing LMS data
- **Docker** - For containerizing the application

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites

- Docker installed on your machine

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alfathmhs/Simple-LMS-Project-with-ORM.git
   cd Simple-LMS-Project-with-ORM
   ```

2. **Build and Run Docker**
 Use Docker Compose to build and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

3. **Apply Migrations**

    In a new terminal window, apply the migrations to set up the database tables:

- First, generate migrations
   ```bash
   docker exec simple_lms python manage.py makemigrations
   ```

- Then, apply the migrations
   ```bash
   docker exec simple_lms python manage.py migrate
   ```

4. **Restart the Docker Containers**

   After applying migrations, restart the Docker containers to ensure all changes are loaded correctly:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart
   ```

5. **Import Dummy Data**
To test the application with some dummy data, run the following command:
   ```bash
   docker exec simple_lms python importer.py
   ```

6. **(Optional) Creating a Default Superuser**

   If you need to create a default superuser to access the Django admin panel, use the following Docker command:
   ```bash
   docker exec simple_lms python manage.py createsuperuser
   ```

7. **Access the Application**
- Visit http://localhost:8081/admin to access the Django admin panel.
- Explore the API endpoints described below.
